        Hey, I&apos;m Val! I&apos;m a Design Engineer with 2+ years in
        experience building SaaS products and various other creative projects.
        With my love for art and eye for design, I am able to fill in the gaps
        between developers and designers. I believe communication is key in
        every relationship, and I absolutely love a good sandwich.
